        <p>With a BSc in Theoretical Physics and an MSc in Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces under my belt, 
          you'd think I was destined to be the next Einstein. But plot twist - I ended up in game development!</p>
        <p>Back in university, I took an Object-Oriented Programming module in C++. For my final project, I decided 
          to create a custom ASCII game engine. That experience lit a fire in me for game dev, setting the stage 
          for what was to come.</p>
        <p>By the end of my master's program, I was still fascinated by software development and thought, 
          “Why not make it my job?” So, I jumped into the world of software development, spending five years 
          mostly focused on web dev. I polished my skills and discovered that code can be just as thrilling 
          as solving a physics problem - most of the time, anyway!</p>
        <p>In one of those years, I participated in <em>Ludum Dare</em>, an experience that sparked my passion for game dev 
          all over again. Now, armed with a solid grasp of the Unity engine, I'm thrilled to be working on my first commercial 
          title, <strong>Turtle vs Rabbit</strong>, a sokoban puzzle game that promises to be a fun ride - unless, of course, you're a turtle 
          trying to outrun a rabbit!</p>

                <p>
                  Inspired by Aesop's timeless fable <em>The Tortoise and the Hare</em>, this game aims to be the successor to sokoban 
                  titles like <em>Silversphere</em> and <em>A Monster's Expedition</em>. Currently in the prototype stage, it is designed to feature 
                  10 biomes, with 10 levels each, introducing innovative mechanics in every environment.

            <p>Noah on the Moon, a remake of the <em>Ludum Dare</em> #45 winner <em>Lost in Translation</em>, was my first larger endeavor in <strong>Unity</strong>. 
              It's a <strong>language puzzle game</strong> that served as an educational exercise where I learned both how to use the engine and 
              how to manage a more complex project.</p>

              <p>Battle of Wizards is a unique take on Rock Paper Scissors, and it was my very first game. I built it from the ground
                 up using a <strong>custom ASCII game engine</strong> I created in <strong>C++</strong> for a university module on <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>. 
                 It was a great learning experience and my introduction to game development.</p>
